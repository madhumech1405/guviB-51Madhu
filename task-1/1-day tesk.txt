http/1.1 and http/2 are different version of the hypertext transfer
protocol(http),which is the protocol used  for tranmitting data over
the internet .Here are the main different between http/1.1 and http/2


--Request and Response multiplexing--:
                                     in http/1.1 each Request and Response
requires  a separate connection,which can lead to inefficiencies,especially when 
multiple requsets are made to the same server. http/2 introduce requsetand response
multiplexing,allowing multiple requsets and response to be sent over a single connection
this multiplexing improves of performance by reducing latency and elimation the need
for multiple connection

--binary protocol--:
              while http/1.1 uses a plain text format,http/2 uses
a binary protocol for data tranmission.the binary format allows for
more efficient parsing and reduces the overhea to textual representation.this 
helps to improves performance by reduces the size of the data being connection

--Header compression--:
                 http/2 introduce Header compression,which reduces the size
of the header sent between the client and the server this this compression
technique,known as Hpack ,reduces the amout of data tranmitted resulting in 
faster performance,especially for bandwith constrained connection

--server push--:
                    http/2 includes a server push feature,which allows the
server to proactively sent resources to the clint before they are explicitly
requseted.this can improves performance by reducing the number of round trips 
 requires to fetch all the necessary are resources

 --Backward compatibillity--:
                          http/2 is designed to be fully Backward compatible with
http/1.1 .this means that server that support http/2 can still server request from
client using http/1.1,provding a smooth transition without requiring immediate upgrades
from all client and server

--stream prioritization--:
                   http/2 introduce the concept of stream prioritization
allowing the client to assign priority levels to different resources.this feature
enables more efficient resources allocation and ensure that critical resources
are loades faster
